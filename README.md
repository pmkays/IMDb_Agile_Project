# IMDB Agile Project

## Background
This group project was part of an RMIT course that emphasised the importance of working Agile within a team environment. We were involved in the SDLC from the very start which involved more than just developing the web application. Through requirements elicitation, user stories, acceptance criteria, and testing, we were all able to develop a deeper understanding of the role that Scrum and Agile methodologies play during the SDLC. Continuous delivery was also highlighted through each milestone completed and sprints usually ran for 1-2 weeks. 

## Code
The project was designed to imitate [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) and is written in Java using Javalin Web Framework, Apache Velocity Engine, and MySql for the database.
